# JIRA in command line

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/technodelight/jira.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/technodelight/jira)

This is a command line application _in a proof-of-concept state_ which allows you to do JIRA actions and helps your daily workflow.

For example you could pick a task, develop it, log your time, create a PR and move to tech review stage, everything from command line.
```
$> jira to-pick # alias of a static search filter, listing every ticket in "Ready to develop" stage
$> git checkout develop
$> jira pick PROJ-123 -ab # transition command, where pick stands for "Picked up by dev", -a assigns the ticket to you and -b creates a git branch generated from the ticket summary
$> git commit -a # work, add your stuff as time goes
$> git push origin head; hub pr -b develop # your work is done, create a PR (using github's cli tool)
$> jira log # guessed from the feature branch name, allows you to interactively log your time, with giving you hints using your previous commits
$> jira dev-to # transition command, where dev-to stands for "Dev lead to check"
# loop
```

Features list, in short:
- do any kind of transitions for an issue, defined by your custom aliases (`pick="Picked up by Dev"`)
- create static search queries and recall them by using your custom alias (`to-qa='project = PROJ and status = "QA Approved/Pending Deploy to UAT"'`)
- search issues on-demand by using `jira search`
- log new work/edit existing records against an issue (`jira log PROJ-123 1h "worklog comment" yesterday`)
- list your daily/weekly worklog in a nice manner (`jira dashboard` and `jira dashboard -w`)
- list your / your team's work in progress issues (`jira in-progress` with `-a` to show your team's progress)
- render issue details in terminal (`jira show` with optional issue ID)
- open your issue by issue ID in your default browser (`jira browse`)

And other powerful features such as:
- guess issue ID from your current GIT branch (works with all the commands where an issue key is required!)
- list commit messages as hint when you log your time interactively (by typing `jira log` on issue branch)
- auto-generate branch name from issue summary, auto-checkout to branch (by specifying `-b` option, ie. `jira pick PROJ-123 -b`)
- change assignee on transition (`-a` to assign it to you, `-u` to unassign)
- show branches and open pull requests for issue (you need github's `hub` tool available for PR list)
- refer to issues by aliases (`meeting=GEN-123` where GEN-123 is a general ticket you use for meetings)

Please bear in mind *this app is still in development phase* and it may contain bugs, although it's pretty much stable most of the time.

# Installation
### 1. Get the phar

  a) Check out the github releases tab and download the latest `jira.phar`.
  
  b) Or, build your own using `phar-composer`:
  ```
  phar-composer.phar build technodelight/jira
  ```

### 2. Then place it to somewhere, make it executable:

  ```
  chmod +x /path/to/downloads/jira.phar
  mv /path/to/downloads/jira.phar /path/to/somewhere/jira
  ```

### 3. You just need to add the above path to your bash profile (or simply move it to somewhere which is already in `$PATH`:

  ```
  PATH=~/path/to/somewhere:$PATH
  ```
  (This step varies across different shells, please refer to the respective manuals)

# Configuration
You can have per-project and global configurations, which would be merged as it was one.
For example if you manage multiple projects on the same jira instance, you could add your login details into the global configuration file (`$HOME/.jira.yml`), while having issue aliases and transitions in your per-project one.
Initialising the configuration is as easy as running the `init` command in your project directory, or using `init -g` to generate an empty global (user specific) configuration file.

The `transitions` and `filters` would appear as new commands, while the issue aliases could be used for issue related actions (time tracking for example).
